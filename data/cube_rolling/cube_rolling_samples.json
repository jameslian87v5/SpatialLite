{"question": "Cube rolling is the ability to simulate object movement in three-dimensional space. This seemingly simple task actually involves complex cognitive processes, including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and working memory. It's like being in your own mental world where you can manipulate objects at will, observing them from different angles and perspectives.\n\nIn this cube rolling test, you need to complete the following task:\n\n1. First, we provide an initial cube with six faces of different colors: \"front\": \"blue\", \"back\": \"gray\", \"left\": \"yellow\", \"right\": \"green\", \"top\": \"red\", \"bottom\": \"black\".\n\n2. This cube will roll along a specific path, and with each roll, the orientation of the cube changes, causing different colored faces to point in different directions. The colors of each face remain the same, but their positions relative to the directions (top, bottom, left, right, front, back) change. For example, when rolling to the right, the original right face becomes the bottom face, the original top face becomes the right face, the original left face becomes the top face, and the original bottom face becomes the left face, while the front and back faces remain unchanged. Similar transformations apply when rolling in other directions.\n\n3. The path shown in the image indicates the rolling sequence of the cube. According to the path indicators, the cube needs to roll in a specific order, such as \"right\" (roll to the right), \"front\" (roll forward), \"left\" (roll to the left), and so on.\n\nNow, I need you to answer: If the cube rolls according to the path shown \"right\", \"front\", \"right\", \"front\", \"right\", \"right\", \"front\", \"front\", what color will the front face of the cube be at the end?\n\n", "answer": "After following the rolling path, the front face of the cube will be red.", "image": "cube_rolling_1(8steps).png", "task_type": "cube_rolling", "question_type": "descrip", "initial_state": {"initial_colors": {"front": "blue", "back": "gray", "left": "yellow", "right": "green", "top": "red", "bottom": "black"}, "rolling_path": ["right", "front", "right", "front", "right", "right", "front", "front"], "test_face": "front"}}

{"question": "Cube rolling is the ability to simulate object movement in three-dimensional space. This seemingly simple task actually involves complex cognitive processes, including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and working memory. It's like being in your own mental world where you can manipulate objects at will, observing them from different angles and perspectives.\n\nIn this cube rolling test, you need to complete the following task:\n\n1. First, we provide an initial cube with six faces of different colors: \"front\": \"blue\", \"back\": \"black\", \"left\": \"green\", \"right\": \"red\", \"top\": \"gray\", \"bottom\": \"yellow\".\n\n2. This cube will roll along a specific path, and with each roll, the orientation of the cube changes, causing different colored faces to point in different directions. The colors of each face remain the same, but their positions relative to the directions (top, bottom, left, right, front, back) change. For example, when rolling to the right, the original right face becomes the bottom face, the original top face becomes the right face, the original left face becomes the top face, and the original bottom face becomes the left face, while the front and back faces remain unchanged.
