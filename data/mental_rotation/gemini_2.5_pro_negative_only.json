{"question": "Mental rotation is the ability to imagine an object turning in three-dimensional space. This seemingly simple task involves a complex interplay of cognitive processes, including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and working memory. It's a bit like being the director of your own mental movie, where you can manipulate objects at will, viewing them from different angles and perspectives.\n\nIn this mental rotation test, i need you to complete this task:\n\n1. First, we provide a three-dimensional spatial structure composed of multiple cubes. Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color). The cubes are connected by their faces, forming a combination of different colored cubes.\n\n2. We provide image of the cube combination from 8 isometric (iso) viewpoints: four upper viewpoints (back-top-left, back-top-right, front-top-left, front-top-right)and four lower viewpoints (back-bottom-left, back-bottom-right, front-bottom-left, front-bottom-right), every viewpoints illustrates the 6 orthogonal axises (front, back, top, bottom, left, right).\n\n3. With these 8 isometric viewpoints, you should be able to deduce the relationships of the cubes from different orthogonal viewpoints, specifically along the x, y, and z axes. These are the six orthogonal views: front (z to 0 direction), back (-z to 0 direction), top (-y  direction), bottom (-y to 0 direction), left (-x to 0 direction), and right (x to 0 direction). Note that occlusion relationships exist - for example, from the front view, cubes positioned more forward (larger z values) will obscure cubes positioned further back (smaller z values) that have the same x and y values.\n\nNow, I need you to answer: From the front viewpoint, how many fully visible cubes can you see, and what are their colors? The obscured cubes should not be included.\n\n##  Response example: …… From the front view, you can see a total of 5 cubes.\nBlue: 2 cubes;\nGreen: 1 cube;\nYellow: 1 cube;\nRed: 1 cube\n", "answer": "From the front view, you can see a total of 7 cubes\nYellow: 2 cubes;\nBlack: 2 cubes;\nRed: 1 cube;\nGray: 1 cube;\nGreen: 1 cube", "options": [], "image": "structure-100_combined_all_views.png", "image_string": "", "caption": "", "explanation": "", "deduction": "", "prompt": "", "raw_output": "", "pred": "", "task_type": "mental_rotation", "score": -1.0, "environment_type": "", "question_type": "descrip", "execution_format": "", "execution_example": "", "formatted_execution_plan": [], "initial_state": {"0,0,0": "red", "0,0,1": "black", "0,0,-1": "blue", "0,-1,-1": "green", "0,-1,1": "yellow", "-1,0,0": "gray", "1,0,-1": "blue", "1,1,-1": "red", "0,-2,-1": "black", "1,0,0": "yellow", "0,1,0": "green", "1,0,-2": "gray"}, "final_state": {}, "reasoning_content": "", "total_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "raw_parse_actions": ""}

{"question": "Mental rotation is the ability to imagine an object turning in three-dimensional space. This seemingly simple task involves a complex interplay of cognitive processes, including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and working memory. It's a bit like being the director of your own mental movie, where you can manipulate objects at will, viewing them from different angles and perspectives.\n\nIn this mental rotation test, i need you to complete this task:\n\n1. First, we provide a three-dimensional spatial structure composed of multiple cubes. Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color). The cubes are connected by their faces, forming a combination of different colored cubes.\n\n2.

{"question": "Mental rotation is the ability to imagine an object turning in three-dimensional space. This seemingly simple task involves a complex interplay of cognitive processes, including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and working memory. It's a bit like being the director of your own mental movie, where you can manipulate objects at will, viewing them from different angles and perspectives.\n\nIn this mental rotation test, i need you to complete this task:\n\n1. First, we provide a three-dimensional spatial structure composed of multiple cubes. Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color). The cubes are connected by their faces, forming a combination of different colored cubes.\n\n2.

Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color). The cubes are connected by their faces, forming a combination of different colored cubes.\n\n2. We provide image of the cube combination from 8 isometric (iso) viewpoints: four upper viewpoints (back-top-left, back-top-right, front-top-left, front-top-right)and four lower viewpoints (back-bottom-left, back-bottom-right, front-bottom-left, front-bottom-right), every viewpoints illustrates the 6 orthogonal axises (front, back, top, bottom, left, right).\n\n3. With these 8 isometric viewpoints, you should be able to deduce the relationships of the cubes from different orthogonal viewpoints, specifically along the x, y, and z axes. These are the six orthogonal views: front (z to 0 direction), back (-z to 0 direction), top (-y  direction), bottom (-y to 0 direction), left (-x to 0 direction), and right (x to 0 direction). Note that occlusion relationships exist - for example, from the front view, cubes positioned more forward (larger z values) will obscure cubes positioned further back (smaller z values) that have the same x and y values.\n\nNow, I need you to answer: From the right viewpoint, how many fully visible cubes can you see, and what are their colors? The obscured cubes should not be included.\n\n##  Response example: …… From the front view, you can see a total of 5 cubes.\nBlue: 2 cubes;\nGreen: 1 cube;\nYellow: 1 cube;\nRed: 1 cube\n", "answer": "From the right view, you can see a total of 2 cubes\nGray: 1 cube;\nRed: 1 cube", "options": [], "image": "structure-16_combined_all_views.png", "image_string": "", "caption": "", "explanation": "", "deduction": "", "prompt": "", "raw_output": "", "pred": "", "task_type": "mental_rotation", "score": -1.0, "environment_type": "", "question_type": "descrip", "execution_format": "", "execution_example": "", "formatted_execution_plan": [], "initial_state": {"0,0,0": "green", "1,0,0": "gray", "1,0,-1": "black", "2,0,-1": "red", "0,0,-1": "blue"}, "final_state": {}, "reasoning_content": "", "total_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "raw_parse_actions": ""}

Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color).

In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color).

{"question": "Mental rotation is the ability to imagine an object turning in three-dimensional space.

First, we provide a three-dimensional spatial structure composed of multiple cubes. Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color).

{"question": "Mental rotation is the ability to imagine an object turning in three-dimensional space. This seemingly simple task involves a complex interplay of cognitive processes, including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and working memory. It's a bit like being the director of your own mental movie, where you can manipulate objects at will, viewing them from different angles and perspectives.\n\nIn this mental rotation test, i need you to complete this task:\n\n1. First, we provide a three-dimensional spatial structure composed of multiple cubes. Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color). The cubes are connected by their faces, forming a combination of different colored cubes.\n\n2. We provide image of the cube combination from 8 isometric (iso) viewpoints: four upper viewpoints (back-top-left, back-top-right, front-top-left, front-top-right)and four lower viewpoints (back-bottom-left, back-bottom-right, front-bottom-left, front-bottom-right), every viewpoints illustrates the 6 orthogonal axises (front, back, top, bottom, left, right).\n\n3. With these 8 isometric viewpoints, you should be able to deduce the relationships of the cubes from different orthogonal viewpoints, specifically along the x, y, and z axes.

The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color). The cubes are connected by their faces, forming a combination of different colored cubes.\n\n2. We provide image of the cube combination from 8 isometric (iso) viewpoints: four upper viewpoints (back-top-left, back-top-right, front-top-left, front-top-right)and four lower viewpoints (back-bottom-left, back-bottom-right, front-bottom-left, front-bottom-right), every viewpoints illustrates the 6 orthogonal axises (front, back, top, bottom, left, right).\n\n3. With these 8 isometric viewpoints, you should be able to deduce the relationships of the cubes from different orthogonal viewpoints, specifically along the x, y, and z axes. These are the six orthogonal views: front (z to 0 direction), back (-z to 0 direction), top (-y  direction), bottom (-y to 0 direction), left (-x to 0 direction), and right (x to 0 direction). Note that occlusion relationships exist - for example, from the front view, cubes positioned more forward (larger z values) will obscure cubes positioned further back (smaller z values) that have the same x and y values.\n\nNow, I need you to answer: From the right viewpoint, how many fully visible cubes can you see, and what are their colors? The obscured cubes should not be included.\n\n##  Response example: …… From the front view, you can see a total of 5 cubes.\nBlue: 2 cubes;\nGreen: 1 cube;\nYellow: 1 cube;\nRed: 1 cube\n", "answer": "From the right view, you can see a total of 7 cubes\nGray: 2 cubes;\nGreen: 2 cubes;\nRed: 2 cubes;\nBlue: 1 cube", "options": [], "image": "structure-82_combined_all_views.png", "image_string": "", "caption": "", "explanation": "", "deduction": "", "prompt": "", "raw_output": "", "pred": "", "task_type": "mental_rotation", "score": -1.0, "environment_type": "", "question_type": "descrip", "execution_format": "", "execution_example": "", "formatted_execution_plan": [], "initial_state": {"0,0,0": "gray", "0,0,1": "blue", "1,0,1": "yellow", "1,-1,1": "green", "2,0,1": "black", "1,1,1": "red", "0,0,-1": "red", "3,0,1": "green", "-1,0,0": "black", "0,0,2": "yellow", "1,-1,0": "gray", "1,0,2": "blue"}, "final_state": {}, "reasoning_content": "", "total_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "raw_parse_actions": ""}

{"question": "Mental rotation is the ability to imagine an object turning in three-dimensional space. This seemingly simple task involves a complex interplay of cognitive processes, including visual perception, spatial reasoning, and working memory. It's a bit like being the director of your own mental movie, where you can manipulate objects at will, viewing them from different angles and perspectives.\n\nIn this mental rotation test, i need you to complete this task:\n\n1. First, we provide a three-dimensional spatial structure composed of multiple cubes. Each cube has a different color, and they are orthogonally arranged in front, back, left, right, top, and bottom directions. The cubes are arranged so that each newly placed cube is perfectly face‐aligned with the existing structure. In other words, one of its faces fully coincides with a face of the already placed cubes along the orthogonal axes, with no partial overlaps or offsets in any other directions. This ensures that edges and corners match exactly, resulting in a strictly “flush” grid‐like arrangement.The number of cubes is randomly generated from 4 to 13, and the cube colors are randomly selected from red, yellow, blue, green, gray, and black (with all six faces of each cube having the same color). The cubes are connected by their faces, forming a combination of different colored cubes.\n\n2. We provide image of the cube combination from 8 isometric (iso) viewpoints: four upper viewpoints (back-top-left, back-top-right, front-top-left, front-top-right)and four lower viewpoints (back-bottom-left, back-bottom-right, front-bottom-left, front-bottom-right), every viewpoints illustrates the 6 orthogonal axises (front, back, top, bottom, left, right).\n\n3. With these 8 isometric viewpoints, you should be able to deduce the relationships of the cubes from different orthogonal viewpoints, specifically along the x, y, and z axes.
