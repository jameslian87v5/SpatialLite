What would be the number of small 1 * 1 green squares in the up face after completing the move sequence?", "answer": 9, "task_type": "rubiks_cube", "question_type": "descrip", "initial_state": {"moves": "D F F3", "query_face": "up", "start_position": {"left": [["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"]], "right": [["yellow", "yellow", "yellow"], ["yellow", "yellow", "yellow"], ["yellow", "yellow", "yellow"]], "down": [["grey", "grey", "grey"], ["grey", "grey", "grey"], ["grey", "grey", "grey"]], "up": [["green", "green", "green"], ["green", "green", "green"], ["green", "green", "green"]], "back": [["blue", "blue", "blue"], ["blue", "blue", "blue"], ["blue", "blue", "blue"]], "front": [["orange", "orange", "orange"], ["orange", "orange", "orange"], ["orange", "orange", "orange"]]}, "query_colour": "green", "question_type": "count_color"}, "final_state": {"left": [["red", "red", "red"], ["red", "red", "red"], ["blue", "blue", "blue"]], "right": [["yellow", "yellow", "yellow"], ["yellow", "yellow", "yellow"], ["orange", "orange", "orange"]], "down": [["grey", "grey", "grey"], ["grey", "grey", "grey"], ["grey", "grey", "grey"]], "up": [["green", "green", "green"], ["green", "green", "green"], ["green", "green", "green"]], "back": [["blue", "blue", "blue"], ["blue", "blue", "blue"], ["yellow", "yellow", "yellow"]], "front": [["orange", "orange", "orange"], ["orange", "orange", "orange"], ["red", "red", "red"]]}}
