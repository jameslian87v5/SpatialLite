{"question": "Consider a sliding block puzzle of grid size 5 * 4 units. This sliding block puzzle has 9 blocks of varying sizes: one 2x2, four 1x2, two 2x1, and two 1x1. The blocks are  on a 5x4 grid with two empty 1x1 spaces. The blocks cannot be removed from the grid, and may only be slide horizontally and vertically within its boundary. A move is defined as selecting a block that is slideable, and moving it by 1 unit either left, right, up, or down, whichever is possible. And the blocks cannot be rotated or overlapped, it means that you can only slide the wooden blocks which are adjacent to the empty spaces. The image shows the starting state and target state of the puzzle grid. The wooden blocks are shown in various shades of brown which have black edges and the empty spaces are shown in white. The starting state is shown in the left image, and the target state is shown in the right image. Now the question is how to move the blocks to reach the target state from the starting state? You can only slide one block at a time, please provide the action sequence required to reach the target state from the starting state.\n\nThe grid also can be represented by characters, the empty spaces are denoted by 0, the number 1-9 represents the blocks id, the number will appear multiple times if the block occupies multiple 1 * 1 units, like 1 appears 4 times which means block 1 occupies 4 1 * 1 units, but the wooden blocks can only be moved as a whole, which means the four 1x1 blocks of block 1 can only be moved in the same direction.\n\ninitial_state_map = [\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        2,\n        2\n    ],\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        3,\n        3\n    ],\n    [\n        0,\n        0,\n        4,\n        5\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        8,\n        8\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        9,\n        9\n    ]\n]\nfinal_state_map = [\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        2,\n        2\n    ],\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        0,\n        0\n    ],\n    [\n        4,\n        5,\n        3,\n        3\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        8,\n        8\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        9,\n        9\n    ]\n]\n", "answer": "", "image": "solution_001_easy.png", "task_type": "wood_slide", "environment_type": "wood_slide", "question_type": "descrip", "initial_state": {"map": [[1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 3, 3], [0, 0, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 8], [6, 7, 9, 9]], "descrip": {"empty": "0", "block_1": "1", "block_2": "2", "block_3": "3", "block_4": "4", "block_5": "5", "block_6": "6", "block_7": "7", "block_8": "8", "block_9": "9"}}, "final_state": {"map": [[1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 0, 0], [4, 5, 3, 3], [6, 7, 8, 8], [6, 7, 9, 9]], "descrip": {"empty": "0", "block_1": "1", "block_2": "2", "block_3": "3", "block_4": "4", "block_5": "5", "block_6": "6", "block_7": "7", "block_8": "8", "block_9": "9"}}}

The image shows the starting state and target state of the puzzle grid. The wooden blocks are shown in various shades of brown which have black edges and the empty spaces are shown in white. The starting state is shown in the left image, and the target state is shown in the right image. Now the question is how to move the blocks to reach the target state from the starting state? You can only slide one block at a time, please provide the action sequence required to reach the target state from the starting state.\n\nThe grid also can be represented by characters, the empty spaces are denoted by 0, the number 1-9 represents the blocks id, the number will appear multiple times if the block occupies multiple 1 * 1 units, like 1 appears 4 times which means block 1 occupies 4 1 * 1 units, but the wooden blocks can only be moved as a whole, which means the four 1x1 blocks of block 1 can only be moved in the same direction.\n\ninitial_state_map = [\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        2,\n        2\n    ],\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        0,\n        0\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        3,\n        3\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        4,\n        5\n    ],\n    [\n        9,\n        9,\n        8,\n        8\n    ]\n]\nfinal_state_map = [\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        2,\n        2\n    ],\n    [\n        1,\n        1,\n        0,\n        0\n    ],\n    [\n        4,\n        5,\n        3,\n        3\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        8,\n        8\n    ],\n    [\n        6,\n        7,\n        9,\n        9\n    ]\n]\n", "answer": "", "image": "solution_049_hard.png", "task_type": "wood_slide", "environment_type": "wood_slide", "question_type": "descrip", "initial_state": {"map": [[1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 7, 3, 3], [6, 7, 4, 5], [9, 9, 8, 8]], "descrip": {"empty": "0", "block_1": "1", "block_2": "2", "block_3": "3", "block_4": "4", "block_5": "5", "block_6": "6", "block_7": "7", "block_8": "8", "block_9": "9"}}, "final_state": {"map": [[1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 0, 0], [4, 5, 3, 3], [6, 7, 8, 8], [6, 7, 9, 9]], "descrip": {"empty": "0", "block_1": "1", "block_2": "2", "block_3": "3", "block_4": "4", "block_5": "5", "block_6": "6", "block_7": "7", "block_8": "8", "block_9": "9"}}}
{"question": "Consider a sliding block puzzle of grid size 5 * 4 units. This sliding block puzzle has 9 blocks of varying sizes: one 2x2, four 1x2, two 2x1, and two 1x1. The blocks are  on a 5x4 grid with two empty 1x1 spaces. The blocks cannot be removed from the grid, and may only be slide horizontally and vertically within its boundary. A move is defined as selecting a block that is slideable, and moving it by 1 unit either left, right, up, or down, whichever is possible. And the blocks cannot be rotated or overlapped, it means that you can only slide the wooden blocks which are adjacent to the empty spaces.
